Tamaghostchi is a virtual pet game using AR technology. This game lets users take care of a Tuyul (an Indonesian ghost). It might seem like a horror game, but itâ€™s actually fun and not scary at all.

In this game, you can feed the Tuyul and rock it to make it happy. The Tuyul will then give you money, as the myth tells us about Tuyul. The objective of the game is simple: maintain the hunger level and happiness level of the Tuyul. The game will end if either the hunger bar or the happiness bar becomes empty, triggering a jumpscare scene.
